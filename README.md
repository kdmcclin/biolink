#BioLink

##The problem

This app is intended to help adopted children and biological parents reconnect.  Some states have very restrictive laws that make it nearly impossible to accomplish this through petitioning the legal system.  The existing ways to do this online, whether website-based or through social media blasts, are out of date or inefficient.

##Live site

A work in progress version of the app is live at [BioLink](http://biolink.herokuapp.com/).

##Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this app, I welcome suggestions and pull requests.  See installation info below.

## Installation
BioLink is built with a Rails backend. To set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/kdmcclin/biolink.git
```

Run bundle:

```
bundle install
```
**Note:** If you're using a Windows development environment you may need to alter the tzinfo gem to cover your operating system. This gem is unnecessary for non-Windows users.

Start the server:

```
rails s
```
