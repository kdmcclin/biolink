#BioLink

##The problem

This app is intended to help adopted children and biological parents reconnect.  Some states have very restrictive laws that make it nearly impossible to accomplish this through petitioning the legal system.  The existing ways to do this online, whether website-based or through social media blasts, are out of date or inefficient.

## Installation
BioLink is built with a Rails backend. To set up:

```
github link to be added later
```

Run bundle:

```
bundle install
```

Start the server:

```
rails s
```
